# Blockchain Essentials
Bussiness networks today are often inefficient because each participant in the network keeps record, or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. The process is expensive because of the duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.
One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.
